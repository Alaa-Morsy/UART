# UART
A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/ Transmitter Verilog project  
the project is consists of 4 sub modules:
  1. Parity generator
  2.Frame generator
  3.Baud rate generator
  4.Parallel input serial output (PISO) register
 -> the features of the UART in UART_full_features.JPG
 -> the summery of the project in UART.pdf
 ->every submodule has its test module
 ->the whole project in final_uart-1.v
